WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br/>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br/>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br/>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br/>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br/>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br/>
